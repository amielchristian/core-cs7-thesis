# Adapting Vision Transformers for Diabetic Retinopathy Classification with Class Activation Map-Guided Knowledge Distillation

This repository contains the code for the study T2Distill-GradCAM: Learning Vision Transformers using Two-Teacher Knowledge Distillation with Autoencoders and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps in Diabetic Retinopathy Classification, accepted for publication and presentation at the 25th International Conference on Computing and Artificial Intelligence.

The implementation of the Vision Transformer architecture in this study is based on that of [faustomorales](https://github.com/faustomorales/vit-keras). The preprocessing techniques are also based in part on [sveitser](https://github.com/sveitser/kaggle_diabetic/blob/master/convert.py)'s implementation.

Note that this repository does not contain the EyePACS fundus image dataset, which can be accessed through its [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/diabetic-retinopathy-detection).
