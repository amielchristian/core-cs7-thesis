# Adapting Vision Transformers for Diabetic Retinopathy Classification with Class Activation Map-Guided Knowledge Distillation

This repository contains the code for the study "Adapting Vision Transformers for Diabetic Retinopathy Classification with Class Activation Map-Guided Knowledge Distillation". 

The implementation of the Vision Transformer architecture in this study is based on that of [faustomorales](https://github.com/faustomorales/vit-keras). The preprocessing techniques are also based in part on [sveitser](https://github.com/sveitser/kaggle_diabetic/blob/master/convert.py)'s implementation.

Note that this repository does not contain the EyePACS fundus image dataset, which can be accessed through its [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/diabetic-retinopathy-detection).
